## Comparer-Pkg

This package can be used for comparing objects and search for objects and any other
type in a 2-dimensional array.

### Github

Here is the [Github-repo](https://github.com/DavidNaderer03/sorting). On the repo
are code examples of the package. Comment issues
if you find bugs. In the next time I will use a package like jest or something to 
test the package.
